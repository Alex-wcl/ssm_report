# SSM —— Spring,Spring mvc,Mybatis
### Made a report system by SSM,add the necessary dependencies to make project as lightweight as possible. 
### You can import it as a maven webapp in eclipse.
### I used the Mybatis Generator to create the DAO module.
### All the test data has been placed in reports.sql,you can execute it directly after creating a database named 'reports' in your mysql.
